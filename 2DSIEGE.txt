2D SIEGE IDEAS/DOCS

game features:
	steam power:
		* this idea is that most weapons/items run on steam, so the game could 
		have more of a survival element to it where collecting steam cannisters
		(which could be carried outside of inventory, with a cap on how many)
		is critical to be able to have weapons work. weapons may have their own 
		ammo type as well, or just run on steam cannisters.

general player setup/controls:
	inventory:
		* essentially has four 'slots'
		* two of them are equipable/unequipable for general items/weapons
		* other two are character specific pre-equipped abilities(listed below in 'characters')


weapons:
	dagger{
		can be collected to be thrown, each can be used as weak melee weapon.
	}
	blade{
		strong melee weapon, longer reach than dagger.
	}
	shield{
		can block things when equipped. higher levels may allow for other weapons to be used at
		the same time.
	}
	heavy pistol{
		player can hold up to 8 ammo at one time.
		ammo can be loaded into gun by pressing reload while equipped.
		(takes 2.3 seconds to reload)
		shoots one shot that deals heavy dmg to anything.
		bullets are inaccurate at long range.-
		good accuraccy at short range.
	}

items

characters:
	smokes:
		[very simple]
		has two smoke bomb types. one is dark and hard to see through, and the other is much easier
		to see through and is like poison to all inside.
	grapple:
		[simple yet hard to master]
		two different grappling hooks. first can be shot and held to quickly fly towards
		walls. second can be deployed to repel above the ground across rooms/tunnels to repel
		alongst it.
	snipe:
		[medium complexity]
		has two crossbows with different uses. the first shoots light arrows that illuminate
		their surroundings. this light releases a powerful flash to those near it and facing its
		direction when it impacts. the second can be shot to deal high damage to players.
	mech:
		[most complex player class] 
		the player has no abilities, unless inside the exosuit
		the player himself is a small character with reduced stats. the
		character owns a mech/exosuit that he can climb into or out of. when in the exosuit, he has
		two abilities- swing/block with arms in faced direction and grab/throw in faced direction.
		the mechs swing/block- swing does a melee attack with high dmg to near targets in front of 
		mech. block- crosses mech arms in front of mech in attempt to block oncoming attacks.
		if attack is blockable, the mech blocks the attack and if not the mech lessens dmg.
		grab/throw- mech grabs targeted object and throws when clicked again. this can be anything 
		from characters to large chunks of environment. the mech also has weaknesses- after taking 
		heavy dmg, such as bombs etc. it can be destroyed. and it has to be powered to be active. 
		if it loses power it shuts down. it can be powered by two tubes- with a sizably long length
		each. the tubes can be attached to active steam pipes/access on maps to be active and
		power the mech the tubes can be unplugged/damaged needing the player to exit the mech and
		fix/plug back in.
		(other idea for mech is to make so that the mec=h can hold normal weapons and there is
		no grab/swing etc.- the two tubes take the two ability slots?)
	pyro:
		[simple yet hard to master]
		has two pyro tubes that can be versatile and fired for different effects. he can fire
		the at the ground for a directional jump-dash this tubes pressure can be adjusted for more
		or less powerful blasts(steam canisters). he can fire the second directly into a wall 
		to blast a hole through the wall. -
	-IDEAS-:(need to develop further)
	mole:
		[hard to play, very powerful when mastered]
		can tunnel into walls and ground. can sabotage many things from enemy mech to ships
		to environment. good players can make traps out of environment for other team.
	flank:
		has good movement with dash ability and cloak-throws small moving steam clusters 
		from self, one of which has the player in it. these clusters, when shot can be dispersed
		to discover player position
